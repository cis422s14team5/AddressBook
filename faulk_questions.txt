Address Book

- Print out all the entries in the addres book in "mailing label" format

- File operations should be performed using standard New, Open, Close, Save and Save As ... File menu options.

- allow for multiple address books to be open, each with its own window which can be closed separately. In this case, New and Open will result in creating a new window, without affecting the current window.

- keep track of whether any changes have been made to an address book since it was last saved and offer the user the opportunity to save changes when an address book is closed either explicitly or as a result of choosing to create/open another or quitting the program.

There is a contradiction:
    - When creating/opening a new address book from the All Address Books view, do you want to keep multiple address book windows open or do you want them to close as a result of creating/opening a new address book.

open address book
    save state

if address book is closed 
    offer the user the opportunity to save changes

if program is closed
    offer the user the opportunity to save changes to all open address books

if address book is opened or new address book is created
    offer the user the opportunity to save changes to all open address books 
    
Ask Faulk 
 - what save and save as should do
 - how to represent address book names in the book list, now file names, should we
   use titles?
 - What are the required fields? Is is it just last name?


- support importing and exporting a set of addresses to other address books. (I'm interpreting this as creating a new address book from the import)

-  It must be possible to extend and update the addressbook design as requirements change. (Hence my emphasis on modularity)
